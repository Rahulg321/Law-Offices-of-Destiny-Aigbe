      "Unlike other law firms, we value practical experience as much as legal expertise. We are not afraid to roll up our sleeves and get to know our clients' business. As a Firm, we strive to proactively address client concerns and not simply react to them.  Problem solving is a Firm priority.  As a result, we are able to recognize and alert our clients to legal and business issues even before our clients know that they exist. Clients value our proactive, hands-on, innovative approach and our ability to work alongside them to achieve their business goals.",

    description:
      "The Firm has adopted a flexible approach to fee arrangements in a rapidly changing law firm economic landscape. We understand that clients not only want to control the overall cost of legal counsel, but also value predictability and accountability. Our flexible approach to fee arrangements means collaborating with our clients to best meet their needs for high-quality legal work delivered economically, efficiently, and predictably. We work with clients to create effective fee arrangements based on the matter and project involved, which we strongly believe to be mutually beneficial for both the Firm and the client. In addition to a standard hourly arrangement, the Firm’s confidence in its ability to drive transactions to closing allows us to offer our clients success-based fee arrangements, flat-fees, hybrid fixed fees, as well as payment in equity in certain instances. Our clients appreciate these alternative fee arrangements as it often aligns all parties’ interests.",
